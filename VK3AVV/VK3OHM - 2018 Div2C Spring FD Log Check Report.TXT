======================================================================


The logging accuracy has not changed to any extent over the last couple
of years, so maybe this is as good as can be achieved. 

Incorrectly copied exchanges which are 'off by one' are still very prevalent,
accounting for a sigificant portion of the incorrectly copied exchange errors.
Still no explanation for it, but please take care to fully log a contact
before starting the next one.

There are still large contact time stamps errors at times. It is hard to
understand how errors in time of up to an hour can arise when computer 
logging is used in real time.

The algorithm to resolve which log may be correct when a time stamp error
occurs can be explained by the following example. Station A logs a contact
at say 03:00 with Station B who logs the same contact at 04:00, one hour later.
If Station A then logs a verified contact (that is within 5 minutes in each
log) with Station C at 03:30, then Station A is much more likely to have 
logged the first contact correctly and Station B looses that contact. To 
resolve shorter intervals requires many verified contacts and there are never
enough.

Thank you to all who submitted log(s). Please encourage others to do the same.
All logs are useful, irrespective of how many contacts, and there were many
more logs that could have been submitted. Suggestions on how to make the
process to submit logs easier would be very welcome.
