======================================================================

Repeating again from previous field days, many logs are still not checked after the 
field day (which is allowed and almost expected in this contest) before uploading, 
and it is sad to see heaps of points being lost due to simple typing errors that 
could have been easily corrected.
 
A great improvement this time has been in time keeping, with only a few time errors
and none over 10 minutes.

However, there is an inordinate increase in the number of cross-band contacts where 
the station at fault could not be reliably determined, hence the lower score band was
used in both logs. Surprisingly, most of the time, the bands involved were 6m, 2m, 
and 70cm, bands on which the rig frequency should be easily read by OmniRig.

It is pleasing to note an increase in activity in VK7, although they seem to have
problems working the mainland, and return of some activity in VK6 compared to 
nothing being heard from there in the Spring field day last year, although they
also still seem to have problems getting across their border.


For interest, the 6-year statistics for Summer field day are as follows.

        153  ( 102    172     98     200      ?)  Corrected worked locators


Worth mentioning is the logging of VK7KPC who worked portable in VK5 call area.
Unfortunately, no one logged contacts with him correctly. In VKCL, single characters
after a '/' following the call sign are ignored unless 'P' or 'M' signifying portable
in home call area, and 'Q' for QRP. Contacts logged as VK7KPC/P would therefore be assigned
to his home call area of VK7.  Multiple characters after the '/' designate the call 
area where the station is operating, so VK7KPC/P5 would put him in North Korea, introducing
spurious DX contacts in the statistics.

The correct way to log stations operating outside their home call area, and this applies to
all contests, is to append the call area where the station is working after the home call,
for example, VK7KPC/VK5.  (Some contests prefer it the other way around, that is VK5/VK7KPC,
and VKCL accepts both.)



If there are entries in the last section of the report, please study them carefully
to see whether you can change and/or improve your operating technique to avoid others
copying you incorrectly. Particularly consider the use of ACMA recommended phonetics.
