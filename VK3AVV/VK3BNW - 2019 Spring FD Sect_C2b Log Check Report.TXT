======================================================================

Although Div.1 and Div.2 have been abolished since the 2019 Summer Field Day
(as the market has spoken in favour of distance based scoring), many have not
caught up with it yet (with current VKCL offering both probably not helping),
so there were still logs submitted for both Divisions or just Div.1.

As before, if logs for both divisions were still submitted, log for Div.1 was
ignored, and if only Div.1 log was submitted, it was converted to Div.2, now
only referred to as distance based scoring.


Rover category still seems to be rather miss-understood category and several
logs were re-classified again as portable as they did not comply with the rules.


Again many logs were not checked after the field day (which is allowed and
almost expected in this contest) before submitting, and it was sad to see heaps
of points being lost due to simple typing errors that could have been easily
corrected.

'Preloading' the worked locator from a previous contact can be a great help
in logging, but it can also be a trap if the portable station changes location
and the preloaded locator is not revised, resulting in wrong worked locator
for the rest of the contest.


Field Day statistics:

        102  Logs submitted
        205  Other participating stations (with more than 40 who made at least 10 contacts)

       6640  Number of contacts logged
       4245  Number of contacts checked  (64)

Errors:
         26  Not in log
         39  Call copied incorrectly

         78  Exchange copied incorrectly
         37  Exchange possibly sent incorrectly (off by 1)

          3  Band logged incorrectly
         40  Cross-band unresolved

         11  Time stamp difference above 10 minutes
          5  Time stamp difference 5 to 10 minutes
         50  Time stamp differenc unresolved

        104  Corrected worked locators

The current penalty for incorrect worked locators is not working well for long
distance contacts on 6m, 2m, and 70cm because of the flattening at 700 Km. In 
future, the points will be calculated with corrected locator and then reduced by 20%.

If there are entries in the last section of the report, please study them carefully
to see whether you can improve your technique to avoid others copying you incorrectly.
