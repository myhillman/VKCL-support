======================================================================


As before, all Div.1 logs were converted to Div.2, which is now only referred
to as distance based scoring.


Again Rover category seems to be a very miss-understood category and a couple of
logs were re-classified as portable since they did not comply with the rules for
activating sufficient number of 4-char locators or moving between 4-char locators
sufficiently number of times.


Again many logs were not checked after the field day (which is allowed and
almost expected in this contest) before submitting the log, and it is sad to see 
heaps of points being lost due to simple typing errors that could have been easily
corrected. Missing State designation digits and missing or wrong prefixes are 
easily spotted if the log is displayed in call sign order, and a long distance 
contact could be saved.


In the statistics below, it is pleasing to see an increase in number of stations 
submitting logs, but not sure what other inference can be drawn from the data,


Summer Field Day statistics:
       2020  (2019   2018    2017   2016)  Year

         92  (  80     53      72     81)  Stations submitting logs
        171  ( 178    159     158    191)  Other participating stations 
         42  (  43     37      43     50)  Other participating stations making at
                                                least 10 contacts

       6720  (6629   5977    6473   9064)  Number of contacts logged
       4049  (3750   3355    3853   5993)  Number of contacts checked
        60( 57%     60%)  Percentage of logged contacts checked

Errors:
         10  (  24      8      21     25)  Not in log
         25  (  23     15      18     34)  Call copied incorrectly

         45  (  50     27      85    133)  Exchange copied incorrectly
         20  (  20      ?       ?      ?)  Exchange possibly sent incorrectly
                                                 (off by 1)

          6  (   9      4       0     11)  Contacts logged on wrong band
          6  (  16      8      19      9)  Cross-band contacts unresolved

          3  (  27      3       ?      ?)  Time stamp difference above 10 minutes
          0  (  10      5       ?      ?)  Time stamp difference 5 to 10 minutes
         22  (  17     10      42      ?)  Time stamp differenc unresolved

        102  ( 172     98     200      ?)  Corrected worked locators


The change in penalty for incorrectly worked locators (points calculated with 
corrected locator and then reduced by 20) resulted in higher loss of points
in most cases, particularly in long distance contacts. Do check your worked locator
frequently with the other station to minimise the losses. 



If there are entries in the last section of the report, please study them carefully
to see whether you can change and/or improve your operating technique to avoid others
copying you incorrectly. Particularly consider the use of ACMA recommended phonetics.
