======================================================================


Shortly before the Winter field day, revised field day rules were published
and for those who did not get to read them, a major change was made to 
remove two division option and just use "distance based scoring" for all logs.

Therefore if logs for both divisions were still submitted, log for Div.1 was 
ignored, and if only Div.1 log was submitted, it was converted to Div.2.


Rover category still seems to be rather miss-understood category and several
logs were re-classified as portable as they did not comply with the rules.


Many logs were not checked after the field day (which is allowed and almost
expected in this contest) before submitting, so many points were lost due to 
mal-formed call signs and wrong locators. Check the worked locator on each 
high value contact as wrongly entered locator on the first contact will 
propagate throughout the log when using VKCL.

There was some improvement in contact time stamps, and major improvement in
cross-band contacts (where it was not possible to determine who was at fault) 
and wrong band contacts (where it was possible).

Logs starting at 01:00UTC and 02:00UTC were all accepted, but a few logs had 
a fixed time bias as if their computer did not have correct time. A few logs 
also used local time.  The log output format for next field day will be 
changed to a Cabrillo format, and contacts outside Sat 01:00 UTC to
Sun 00:59 UTC for Winter, and Sat 02:00 UTC to Sun 01:59 UTC for Spring and 
Summer will be ignored.

There will possibly be other changes to the rules for the next field day, so 
read the rules for Spring field day carefully, and if you use VKCL, update
to the latest version before the Spring field day.
