======================================================================

The CLAIMED-SCORE: entry present in the Cabrillo log is a useful check to ensure 
that the log is correctly imported into the contest management software, but for 
various reasons, it does not always agree exactly with the calculated score 
during import.  For the Spring Field Day, the two scores agreed exactly most of 
the time mainly for the latest version of VKCL, Ver 4.13.  Most of the time 
because there was another "small" bug in VKCL which caused assignment of maximum 
points for a logged contact with none or a 4-char locator only, instead of 
assigning minimum points for anything but a correctly formed 6-char or 8-char 
locators. Therefore, the score for logs with missing locators was overestimated.

There was also a small tweak to the value for the radius of earth in the distance 
calculation routine, so previous versions of VKCL can produce slightly different 
results due to small rounding differences.  All discrepancies were investigated, 
and all these problems should be resolved in the latest version, Ver 4.13.1, now 
available, and all are advised to upgrade before the next field day, particularly 
those stations still uploading Div 1 and Div 2 logs.  The upgrade is FREE! 

Repeating from previous field days, many logs are still not checked after the 
field day (which is allowed and almost expected in this contest) before uploading, 
and it is sad to see heaps of points being lost due to simple typing errors that 
could have been easily corrected. When using VKCL in Post-Contest Entry mode, make 
sure to keep the time in VKCL synchronised with your paper log, and ideally have 
the transcription checked by your XYL/OM (as the case may be) or by a grandchild 
(children are usually too busy to help).  Very obvious transcription errors (such 
as clock being off by 12 hours, or wrong date) are corrected, but it is your 
responsibility to ensure that the log is accurate.

As the song asks, "Where have all the Rovers gone?".  No logs from any this time,
and nothing heard from VK6 either, maybe the border closure is still in effect in
the ether.



Spring Field Day statistics:

                                               least 10 contacts

       7808  (6640   5260   4692   4168)  Number of contacts logged
       4552  (4245   3258   2942   2217)  Number of contacts checked

Errors:
         13  (  26      7     11     11)  Not in log
         41  (  39      9      9     16)  Call copied incorrectly

         40  (  78     53     44     44)  Exchange copied incorrectly
         10  (  37      ?      ?      ?)  Exchange possibly sent incorrectly (off by 1)

          3  (   3      8      6      1)  Band logged incorrectly
         11  (  40     14     34      6)  Cross-band, use lwr score band

          1  (  11      6      ?      ?)  Time stamp difference above 10 minutes
          1  (   5      3     54      ?)  Time stamp difference 5 to 10 minutes
         14  (  50     24     21     36)  Time stamp difference unresolved

        138  ( 104    119    151      ?)  Corrected worked locators

The five years of statistics above do not really show much change from year to year, 
perhaps a bit better this year. The higher number of corrected worked locators was 
caused by a log that was uploaded with no worked locator specified for any contact. 
Contacts that could be corrected from logs from stations worked were corrected, with 
a 20 percent penalty, but contacts that could not be so corrected stayed uncorrected, 
with minimum points for the contact.



If there are entries in the last section of your Log Check Report, please study them carefully
to see whether you can improve your technique to avoid others copying you incorrectly.
