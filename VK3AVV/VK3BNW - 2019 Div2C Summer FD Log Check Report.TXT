======================================================================



Incorrectly copied exchanges which are 'off by one' are still very prevalent,
mostly received one higher than sent. There is more indication that the problem
is at the sending end, so these errors have been noted but ignored. If you have
already logged the contact before giving out all the information to the other
station, make sure you use the sent serial number you logged and not the next
one showing.


There seemed to be some improvement in contact time stamps errors, but many 
are still caused by confusion of UTC and local time, am and pm, and not 
advancing the time when using Post-Contest Entry Mode to synchronise the time
in VKCL with your paper log.


The rules require that all contacts made during the field must be in your log 
for cross-checking, irrespective whether 24- or 8-hour log. There were a few
such incomplete 8-hours logs this time, and as previously promised, they were
classified as 'Check Logs'.
